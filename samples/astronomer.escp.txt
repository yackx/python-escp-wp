[justification:center][bold:on]When I heard the learn'd astronomer[bold:off]

by Walt Whitman

When I heard the learn'd astronomer
When the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns before me
When I was shown the charts and diagrams, to add, divide, and measure them
When I sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured
with much applause in the lecture-room
How soon unaccountable I became tired and sick
Till rising and gliding out I wander'd off by myself
In the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time
Look'd up in perfect silence at the stars
